# Distribution and versioning

FlexDoc uses one canonical browser renderer and thin ecosystem adapters. Every adapter release packages or embeds the version-matched renderer rather than implementing its own OpenAPI renderer.

## Current artifacts

| Artifact | Release line | Release tag | Compatibility |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `@prauga/flexdoc-client` | `2.1.x` | `js/v<version>` | canonical renderer; renderer contract v1 |
| `@prauga/flexdoc-backend` | `2.1.x` | `js/v<version>` | matching renderer; contract v1 |
| `@prauga/flexdoc-core` | `0.1.x` | `core/v<version>` | framework-neutral OpenAPI engine |
| `@prauga/flexdoc-cli` | `0.1.x` | `cli/v<version>` | compatible Prauga renderer |
| `com.prauga.flexdoc:flexdoc-spring-boot-starter` | `0.2.x` | `java/v<version>` | renderer contract v1 |
| `prauga-flexdoc` | `0.1.x` | `python/v<version>` | ASGI adapter + embedded renderer |
| `prauga-flexdoc-axum` | `0.1.x` | `rust/v<version>` | Axum adapter + embedded renderer |
| `github.com/prauga/flexdoc/adapters/go` | `0.1.x` | `adapters/go/v<version>` | net/http adapter + embedded renderer |

Versions are intentionally independent across ecosystems. The renderer contract, not matching version numbers, is the cross-ecosystem compatibility boundary.

## Self-contained adapter artifacts

The canonical standalone JS/CSS is built from `packages/client` and synchronized into the Go, Python, and Rust package trees by `npm run sync:adapter-assets`. CI runs `npm run check:adapter-assets` after building the client and byte-compares every committed adapter asset against the canonical output.

This is required because the ecosystems package source differently:

- Go consumes repository contents at the semantic tag, so renderer assets are committed and embedded with `go:embed`.
- Python wheels/sdists package renderer assets as `prauga_flexdoc` package data.
- Rust crates package renderer assets and compile them with `include_bytes!`.
- Spring Boot copies the canonical assets into `META-INF/flexdoc` during Maven packaging.
- Node backend packages the same renderer into its npm artifact.

No adapter requires a FlexDoc CDN at runtime.

## npm

The supported npm identities are `@prauga/flexdoc-client`, `@prauga/flexdoc-backend`, `@prauga/flexdoc-core`, and `@prauga/flexdoc-cli`. Client/backend use the coordinated `js/v...` release line; core and CLI use their own release tags.

Publishing uses npm Trusted Publishing/OIDC and therefore requires the `@prauga` package Trusted Publisher relationships to point at the final `prauga/flexdoc` repository and exact workflow files. See [Prauga package migration](./prauga-migration.md) for the migration/deprecation order.

## Maven Central

The Prauga coordinate is:

```text
com.prauga.flexdoc:flexdoc-spring-boot-starter:0.2.0
```

The Java package namespace is `com.prauga.flexdoc.spring`. Before first publication under this coordinate, verify the `com.prauga.flexdoc` namespace in Central Portal. The old `io.github.bluejeans117...` artifact is not modified or deprecated by the npm migration.

## PyPI

The distribution name is `prauga-flexdoc`; the import package is `prauga_flexdoc`. The wheel contains the canonical renderer assets. `python/v<version>` builds the wheel/sdist and publishes through PyPI Trusted Publishing.

## crates.io

The crate is `prauga-flexdoc-axum`, imported as `prauga_flexdoc_axum`. `rust/v<version>` tests/packages the crate and uses crates.io Trusted Publishing for the release.

## Go

The module is `github.com/prauga/flexdoc/adapters/go`. Because it is a module in a monorepo subdirectory, its semantic tags use Go's submodule convention: `adapters/go/v<version>`. The renderer is embedded in the tagged module source, so there is no additional registry publication step.

## Release checks

Every release should verify at least:

- the expected renderer-contract version;
- exact renderer assets are present in the produced package;
- host HTML loads only local packaged assets by default;
- documentation-route secrets are not serialized to the browser;
- a representative OpenAPI document boots and Try It works;
- package metadata points at Prauga's public source and AGPL license;
- no publishing credential/signing secret exists in a produced package.
