# Prauga FlexDoc Spring Boot Starter

Java/Spring adapter for the canonical FlexDoc browser renderer. The JAR packages the same version-matched `flexdoc.standalone.js` and `flexdoc.standalone.css` used by the other integrations; it does not implement a Java-specific OpenAPI renderer.

Current source version: `0.2.0`. It targets renderer contract v1 / FlexDoc renderer 2.x.

> `com.prauga.flexdoc` is a new Maven coordinate. Do not announce it as generally available until the Prauga namespace has been verified in Maven Central and the first publication has completed.

Coordinates:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.prauga.flexdoc</groupId>
  <artifactId>flexdoc-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
  <version>0.2.0</version>
</dependency>
```

The Java package namespace is `com.prauga.flexdoc.spring`.

## Spring Boot + springdoc

If your application already exposes the standard springdoc endpoint at `/v3/api-docs`, the default configuration is enough. Adding the starter exposes FlexDoc at `/docs`; the browser loads `/v3/api-docs` from the same origin and the shared renderer handles references, Try It, schemas and code examples.

Optional configuration:

```yaml
flexdoc:
  path: /docs
  spec-url: /v3/api-docs
  title: My API
  theme: dark
  try-it-enabled: true
```

The renderer assets are served locally at `/docs/__flexdoc/*`, so the integration has no runtime CDN dependency.

## Classpath or programmatic specs

To embed a checked-in specification instead of using a URL:

```yaml
flexdoc:
  spec-location: classpath:/openapi.json
```

Or provide a `FlexDocSpecProvider` bean for a generated OpenAPI model:

```java
@Bean
FlexDocSpecProvider flexDocSpecProvider(ObjectMapper mapper, OpenAPI openApi) {
  return () -> mapper.convertValue(openApi, Object.class);
}
```

A provider takes precedence over `spec-url`. `spec-location` creates the default provider only when explicitly configured.

## Building in this repository

Build the standalone renderer first, then package and verify the JAR:

```bash
npm run build:client
mvn -f adapters/java-spring/pom.xml verify
jar tf adapters/java-spring/target/flexdoc-spring-boot-starter-0.2.0.jar | grep META-INF/flexdoc
```

The release build attaches source and Javadoc JARs. CI verifies that the resulting JAR contains both canonical renderer assets before publication.

See [`docs/distribution.md`](../../docs/distribution.md) and [`docs/prauga-migration.md`](../../docs/prauga-migration.md) for release and migration details.
